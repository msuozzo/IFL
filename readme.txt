PLT Language Project

Before running ifl, please make sure that you have ply installed. A copy of ply (ply-3.4.tar.gz) is included in the IFL folder. You can find instructions on how to install ply inside of the .tar file.

To run your .ifl files, please place the .ifl in source/ along with any dialogue files (.txt). Then simply enter "./ifl source/your_file.ifl" to compile and run your program! Note that there are three example files that are provided in the folder. You can run them by typing "./ifl 1", "./ifl 2", and "./ifl 3", respectively. If you wish to compile your .ifl manually, you can type "python compile.py source/your_file.ifl". (Note that if you have dialogue files, they must be in source as well.) Then cd into the game/ directory and type "python game.py" to start your game.
